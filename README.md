# README.md


Hi, I'm Weber! An open source developer :D

I'm the author of the WebSette framework. Since 2023, I spent a lot of time on open source projects in order to build tools to facilitate developers lives. I think it helps me personnaly and professionnaly because I have learned a lot of things and I love share everything I know. I will never get tired of it!

I would like to keep working on my framework and its ecosystem and contributing as many as possible for other open source projects.

You can help me to achieve my goals of improving the world through code, help me create better developer experiences, or just say "thank you" by sponsoring me on GitHub. Any and all contributions are greatly appreciated.
